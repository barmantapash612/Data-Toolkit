        "\n",
        "▶\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Reasons:**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Contiguous Memory Allocation**\n",
        "- NumPy arrays are stored in **contiguous memory blocks** (like C arrays).\n",

        "---\n",

        "#### 2. **Fixed Data Types**\n",
        "- All elements in a NumPy array are of the **same type**, allowing NumPy to perform **vectorized operations** at lower levels.\n",
        "- Python lists can hold mixed types, so each element must be checked individually.\n",

        "---\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "####  4. **Underlying C Implementation**\n",

        "###  Example:\n",
